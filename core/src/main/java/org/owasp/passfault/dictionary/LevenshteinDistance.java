  /**
   * Mr. Gilleland,

  As you may know, the Apache Jakarta Commons project had appropriated
  your sample implementation of the Levenshtein Distance algorithm for
  its commons-lang Java library.  While attempting to use it with two
  very large strings, I encountered an OutOfMemoryError, due to the fact
  that a matrix is created with the dimensions of the two strings'
  lengths.  I know you created the implementation to go with your
  (excellent) illustration of the algorithm, so this matrix approach
  translates that illustration and tutorial perfectly.

  However, as I said, the matrix approach doesn't lend itself to getting
  the edit distance of two large strings.  For this purpose, I modified
  your implementation to use two single-dimensional arrays; this is
  clearly more memory-friendly (although it probably results in some very
  slight performance degradation when comparing smaller strings).

  I've submitted the modification to the maintainers of the commons-lang
  project, and I've appended the relevant method below.

  Thanks!

  Chas Emerick

   * @param t target string
   * @return distance between the source and the target

    /*
    The difference between this impl. and the previous is that, rather
    than creating and retaining a matrix of size s.length()+1 by t.length()+1,
    we maintain two single-dimensional arrays of length s.length()+1.  The first, d,
    is the 'current working' distance array that maintains the newest distance cost
    counts as we iterate through the characters of String s.  Each time we increment
    the index of String t we are comparing, d is copied to p, the second int[].  Doing so
    allows us to retain the previous cost counts as required by the algorithm (taking
    the minimum of the cost count to the left, up one, and Diagonally up and to the left
    of the current cost count being calculated).  (Note that the arrays aren't really
    copied anymore, just switched...this is clearly much better than cloning an array
    or doing a System.arraycopy() each time  through the outer loop.)

    Effectively, the difference between the two implementations is this one does not
    cause an out of memory condition when calculating the LD over two very large strings.
